										In a World faced with severe climate change and recurring financial crises it is clear the current economic system is not fit for purpose. A need exists for radical transition to a new economics in Africa, one that can deliver for its people and for the planet. We observe with great trepidation how most of the industrialised economies are increasingly unsustainable, unfair and unstable; meanwhile the African continent is still seen as the Dark Continent faced by grinding poverty, disease and death. After decades of fruitless and debilitating aid we are now faced with donor fatigue and increasingly the continent is being left to its own devices. The recent surge in mass emigration by Africans, willing to risk their lives in treacherous waters to escape the misery that is their existence, calls for urgent revaluation of our political, economic and social life. The need for African countries to relook their strategies and to chart a new future growth path is now if we are to improve the wellbeing of their people and that of future generations.
